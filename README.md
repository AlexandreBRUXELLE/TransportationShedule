###### Note: 
Ð•he program stores transport data, routes, stops, schedules in collections. Parsing takes a long time. Therefore, it is executed only at the first access to resources and stored for one hour. The first treatment takes about 1-4 minutes.
There's really a lot of information out there, at each stop, on your schedule: weekdays and weekends. Routes in one transport in different directions are regarded as different.
